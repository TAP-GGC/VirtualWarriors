# Using Roblox and VR to Inspire Game Development Skills and STEM Interest

# Description
We taught basic game development skills with Roblox Studio to engage students in an interactive manner and foster interest in game development and information technology. The Technology Ambassador Program [(TAP)](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) program at Georgia Gwinnett College aims to attract students to IT and STEM.
